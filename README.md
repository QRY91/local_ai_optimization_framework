**My experiments reducing AI costs with local models**

I was spending $100+/month on cloud AI and it was getting unsustainable. These are my notes and tools for running AI locally instead. Results so far: ~90% cost reduction for my workflows (docs and code analysis).

> **Note**: This worked for my setup - YMMV. Sharing in case it helps others in similar situations.

---

## üéØ The Problem I Had

### **Unsustainable AI Costs**
I was hitting $40+ in 11 days on Zed/Cursor subscriptions, trending toward $120/month. For a solo dev working on docs and technical debt, that's not sustainable long-term.

### **My Approach**
I put together some tools to:
- Test which local models work well for my workflows
- Measure actual performance vs cost trade-offs
- Automate the setup so I don't have to figure it out repeatedly

### **Why I Tried Local AI**
1. **Predictable costs**: Electricity vs subscription fees
2. **Privacy**: Code stays on my machine
3. **Learning**: Understanding how this stuff actually works
4. **Independence**: Not worrying about rate limits or service changes

Results: 90%+ cost reduction for routine work, with strategic cloud AI for complex tasks.

## üìä My Results So Far

### **Cost Changes**
```
Before: ~$120/month cloud AI
After:  ~$10/month (electricity + occasional cloud fallback)
Savings: ~90% for my workflows
```

### **Performance Reality Check**
- **Response Times**: 3-30s depending on task (vs 1-5s cloud)
- **Quality**: Good enough for docs/code analysis, sometimes need cloud for complex stuff
- **Use Cases**: Works well for documentation, basic code analysis, commit messages
- **Hardware**: Tested on 16GB MacBook, seems to need 8GB+ RAM

### **What I Learned**
- Local models are surprisingly capable for routine tasks
- Setup is more involved than I expected but worth it
- Need different models for different use cases
- Cloud AI still valuable for 5-10% of tasks

### **Main Parts**

#### **1. Hardware Testing**
- **Purpose**: Figure out what models work well on your specific machine
- **What it does**: Tests RAM usage, speed, thermal behavior
- **Target**: My use case is docs and code analysis, but might work for other things

#### **2. Model Selection** 
- **Documentation**: Tries to find models that are good at technical writing
- **Code Analysis**: Tests models that understand code reasonably well
- **Quick Tasks**: Fast models for simple stuff like commit messages
- **Fallback**: When to just use cloud AI instead

#### **3. Cost Tracking**
- **Usage monitoring**: Keep track of what you're actually using
- **Model selection**: Try to pick the cheapest model that works for each task
- **Fallback strategy**: Guidelines for when cloud AI is worth the cost
- **Savings tracking**: Measure if this actually saves money

## üöÄ Quick Start (15 minutes)

### **Prerequisites**
- **Ollama**: [Install from ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
- **Go 1.19+**: For the benchmark tools I wrote
- **8GB+ RAM**: Works on my 16GB MacBook, probably needs at least 8GB
- **10GB+ disk space**: Models are big

### **Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/QRY91/local_ai_optimization_framework.git
cd local_ai_optimization_framework

# Run the setup script (might take a while)
./setup_local_ai_optimization.sh --comprehensive

# Apply the configuration it generates
source results/configure_uroboro.sh

# Test it worked
./results/test_local_ai.sh
```

### **Quick Test**
```bash
# Try generating some documentation
ollama run mistral:7b "Create API documentation for a user authentication endpoint"

# See how different models perform on your hardware
cd tools && go run model_comparison.go

# Check what configurations it recommends
ls -la ../results/
```

---

## üéØ What I Use It For

### **Documentation Generation**
- **Models**: `mistral:7b` for most docs, `llama2:13b` when I need higher quality
- **Works well for**: API docs, README files, technical documentation
- **Performance**: 15-30s usually, quality is good enough for most cases
- **When I use cloud**: Customer-facing docs that need to be perfect

### **Code Analysis & Technical Debt**
- **Models**: `codellama:7b` seems best for code stuff
- **Works well for**: Basic code review, spotting obvious issues, documentation generation
- **Performance**: 20-45s, pretty detailed analysis
- **When I use cloud**: Complex architectural decisions, large refactoring plans

### **Quick Development Tasks**
- **Models**: `orca-mini:3b` for speed
- **Works well for**: Commit messages, quick summaries, simple explanations
- **Performance**: 2-5s, good enough quality
- **When I use cloud**: Rarely, this model handles most quick tasks fine

### **Fallback Strategy**
I still budget ~$15/month for cloud AI when local models aren't cutting it (complex problems, tight deadlines, client-facing work).

## üöÄ Try It Out

If you're in a similar situation with AI costs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QRY91/local_ai_optimization_framework.git
cd local_ai_optimization_framework
./setup_local_ai_optimization.sh
```

Fair warning: This might not work on your setup, and the optimization process takes some tweaking. But if it does work, the cost savings are pretty significant.

*Note: This is my personal solution to a specific problem. Your mileage may vary, especially with different hardware or workflows.*
