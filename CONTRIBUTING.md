cd tools
go run low_spec_benchmark.go
go run model_comparison.go

# Validate documentation changes
# Ensure all links work and examples are accurate
```

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### **Code Standards**
- **Shell Scripts**: Use `#!/bin/bash` and `set -e` for error handling
- **Go Code**: Follow standard Go formatting (`go fmt`)
- **Documentation**: Use clear, actionable language with examples
- **Comments**: Explain the "why" not just the "what"

### **Commit Message Format**
Use conventional commits for consistency:
```
feat: add support for Apple Silicon optimization
fix: correct memory calculation for 32GB+ systems  
docs: add troubleshooting guide for thermal issues
test: expand benchmark coverage for documentation tasks
```

### **Pull Request Process**
1. **Create an Issue**: Discuss significant changes before implementing
2. **Small, Focused PRs**: Easier to review and merge
3. **Include Tests**: Ensure new functionality works across environments
4. **Update Documentation**: Keep docs synchronized with code changes
5. **Test on Your Hardware**: Validate changes work in your environment

### **Branch Naming**
- `feature/description` - New functionality
